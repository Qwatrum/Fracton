### Saving data:
- Of course data, your notes or AI chats etc. get saved. It will save all your data each time you close the feature's window. You don't need to press save.
- Drawings are not saved. Timers are not saved either. In order to work their window must be open.
- You can delete your data. Please note: There won't be a confirmation screen!
- Deleting chats, links etc. is irreversible and you won't be asked for confirmation.
- Completed ToDos will get removed when the window is closed.
- When you close the main menu window before closing the other windows, then no data is saved!

### Extra Note for the AI:
- No API key is required (for the .exe) - yay!
- If you build it for yourself, you do need your own API key.
- The current model is: `qwen/qwen3-32b`
- The model uses reasoning. But this is hidden while chatting.
